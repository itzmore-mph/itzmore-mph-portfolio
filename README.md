Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Along with libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, and scipy.
R: Along with packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.
Database Access: Setup to run SQL queries, with access to a SQL server or a local database setup like SQLite.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/itzmore-mph/itzmore-mph-portfolio.git
cd bundesliga-analysis

Running the Analyses
Python
Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and run the Jupyter Notebooks:

jupyter notebook Portfolio-Project_itzmore-mph_Performance-Analysis_Top-5-Clubs_Bundesliga_Germany_Bayer-04-Leverkusen.ipynb
jupyter notebook Portfolio-Project_itzmore-mph_Performance-Analysis_Top-5-Clubs_Bundesliga_Germany_FC-Bayern-Munich.ipynb
jupyter notebook Portfolio-Project_itzmore-mph_Performance-Analysis_Top-5-Clubs_Bundesliga_Germany_VfB-Stuttgart.ipynb
jupyter notebook Portfolio-Project_itzmore-mph_Performance-Analysis_Top-5-Clubs_Bundesliga_Germany_Borussia-Dortmund.ipynb
jupyter notebook Portfolio-Project_itzmore-mph_Performance-Analysis_Top-5-Clubs_Bundesliga_Germany_RB-Leipzig.ipynb

Repeat for other clubs as needed.

SQL
